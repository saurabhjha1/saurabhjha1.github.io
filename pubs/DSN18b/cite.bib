 abstract = {Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is rapidly becoming a reality on U.S. roads, offering the promise of improvements in traffic management, safety, and the comfort and efficiency of vehicular travel. With this increasing popularity and ubiquitous deployment, resilience has become a critical requirement for public acceptance and adoption. Recent studies into the resilience of AVs have shown that though the AV systems are improving over time, they have not reached human levels of automation. Prior work in this area has studied the safety and resilience of individual components of the AV system (e.g., testing of neural networks powering the perception function). However, methods for holistic end-to-end resilience assessment of AV systems are still non-existent.},
