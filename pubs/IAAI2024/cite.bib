Despite these advancements, numerous resources persist unnecessarily due to factors such as poor digital hygiene, risk aversion, or the absence of effective tools, resulting in substantial costs and energy consumption. Existing threshold-based techniques prove inadequate in effectively addressing this challenge. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised machine learning framework to automatically identify resources that can be de-provisioned completely or summoned on a schedule. Application of this approach to enterprise data has yielded promising initial results, facilitating the segregation of productive workloads with recurring demands from non-productive ones.}, number={21}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Yang, Xi and Arora, Rohan R. and Jha, Saurabh and Narayanaswami, Chandra and Lam, Cheuk and Leichter, Jerrold and Deng, Yu and Sow, Daby M.}, year={2024}, month={Mar.}, pages={22990-22996} }
