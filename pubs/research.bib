By utilizing a link-level perspective, we gain generality over analyses which are tied to specific topologies. We illustrate these techniques using five months of a Blue Waters production dataset consisting of network utilization and congestion counters. We find that: i) execution time of the communication-heavy applications is highly correlated to network stalls observed in the network topology and increase in application runtime can be as high as 1.7x with nominal increase in stalls, ii) heterogeneity in the available link bandwidth in the network can lead to backpressure and congestion even when the network is not underprovisioned, and (iii) links connected to I/O nodes are no more likely to observe congestion during operational hours than any other link in the system.},

    abstract={Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is rapidly becoming a reality on U.S. roads, offering the promise of improvements in traffic management, safety, and the comfort and efficiency of vehicular travel. The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) reports that between 2014 and 2017, manufacturers tested 144 AVs, driving a cumulative 1,116,605 autonomous miles, and reported 5,328 disengagements and 42 accidents involving AVs on public roads. This paper investigates the causes, dynamics, and impacts of such AV failures by analyzing disengagement and accident reports obtained from public DMV databases. We draw several conclusions. For example, we find that autonomous vehicles are 15 - 4000Ã- worse than human drivers for accidents per cumulative mile driven; that drivers of AVs need to be as alert as drivers of non-AVs; and that the AVs' machine-learning-based systems for perception and decision-and-control are the primary cause of 64% of all disengagements.},

Data-driven insights into the potentially widespread scope and propagationof impact of events, such as faults and contention for shared resources, can be used to drive more effective use of resources, for improved root cause diagnosis, and for predicting performance impacts. We present work developing integrated capabilities for holistic monitoring and analysis to understand and characterize propagation of performance-degrading events. These characterizations can be used to determine and invoke mitigating responses by system administrators, applications, and system software.},

    abstract={Availability of the interconnection network in high-performance computing (HPC) systems is fundamental to sustaining the continuous execution of applications at scale. When failures occur, interconnect recovery mechanisms orchestrate complex operations to recover network connectivity between the nodes. As the scale and design complexity of HPC systems increase, so does the system's susceptibility to failures during execution of interconnect-recovery procedures. This study characterizes the recovery procedures of the Gemini interconnect network, the largest Gemini network built by Cray, on Blue Waters, a 13.3 petaflop supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). We propose a propagation model that captures interconnect failures and recovery procedures to help understand types of failures and their propagation in both the system and applications during recovery. The measurements show that recovery procedures occur very frequently and that the unsuccessful execution of recovery procedures, when additional failures occur during recovery, causes system-wide outages (SWOs, 28 out of 101) and application failures (3.4 percent of all running applications).},
