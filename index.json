While AV development today involves verification, validation, and testing, end-to-end assessment of AV systems under accidental faults in realistic driving scenarios has been largely unexplored. This paper presents DriveFI, a machine learning-based fault injection engine, which can mine situations and faults that maximally impact AV safety, as demonstrated on two industry-grade AV technology stacks (from NVIDIA and Baidu). For example, DriveFI found 561 safety-critical faults in less than 4 hours. In comparison, random injection experiments executed over several weeks could not find any safety-critical faults.","tags":null,"title":"ML-Based Fault Injection for Autonomous Vehicles: A Case for Bayesian Fault Injection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jha Saurabh","Patke Archit","Showerman Mike","Enos Jeremy","Bauer Greg","Kalbarczyk Zbigniew","Iyer Ravishankar","Kramer William"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588440993,"objectID":"5470594700fdb573f292968b61f4125b","permalink":"https://saurabhjha1.github.io/publication/illinoisdatabank-idb-2921318/","publishdate":"2020-05-02T15:40:22.745093Z","relpermalink":"/publication/illinoisdatabank-idb-2921318/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Monet - Blue Waters Network Dataset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valerio Formicola","Saurabh Jha","Daniel Chen","Fei Deng","Amanda Bonnie","Mike Mason","Jim M.

When failures occur, interconnect recovery mechanisms orchestrate complex operations to recover network connectivity between the nodes. As the scale and design complexity of HPC systems increase, so does the system's susceptibility to failures during execution of interconnect-recovery procedures. This study characterizes the recovery procedures of the Gemini interconnect network, the largest Gemini network built by Cray, on Blue Waters, a 13.3 petaflop supercomputer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA). We propose a propagation model that captures interconnect failures and recovery procedures to help understand types of failures and their propagation in both the system and applications during recovery. The measurements show that recovery procedures occur very frequently and that the unsuccessful execution of recovery procedures, when additional failures occur during recovery, causes system-wide outages (SWOs, 28 out of 101) and application failures (3.4 percent of all running applications).","tags":null,"title":"Resiliency of HPC Interconnects: A Case Study of Interconnect Failures and Recovery in Blue Waters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Jha","Subho Banerjee","James Cyriac","Zbigniew T.

With this increasing popularity and ubiquitous deployment, resilience has become a critical requirement for public acceptance and adoption. Recent studies into the resilience of AVs have shown that though the AV systems are improving over time, they have not reached human levels of automation. Prior work in this area has studied the safety and resilience of individual components of the AV system (e.g., testing of neural networks powering the perception function).

The California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) reports that between 2014 and 2017, manufacturers tested 144 AVs, driving a cumulative 1,116,605 autonomous miles, and reported 5,328 disengagements and 42 accidents involving AVs on public roads. This paper investigates the causes, dynamics, and impacts of such AV failures by analyzing disengagement and accident reports obtained from public DMV databases. We draw several conclusions. For example, we find that autonomous vehicles are 15 - 4000Ã- worse than human drivers for accidents per cumulative mile driven; that drivers of AVs need to be as alert as drivers of non-AVs; and that the AVs' machine-learning-based systems for perception and decision-and-control are the primary cause of 64% of all disengagements.","tags":null,"title":"Hands Off the Wheel in Autonomous Vehicles?: A Systems Perspective on over a Million Miles of Field Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Jha","Timothy Tsai","Siva Kumar Sastry Hari","Michael Sullivan","Zbigniew Kalbarczyk","Stephen W.
